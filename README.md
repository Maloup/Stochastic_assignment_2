# Stochastic Simulation Assignment 2: Queueing Theory
This repository contains the code, figures, and data for the second assignment
of Stochastic Simulation. It is organized in the following files:
- `Result_visualization.ipynb` contains the code for statistical analysis,
  visualizations, and experiments.
- `queue_function.py` implements the queueing experiments.
- `util.py` contains utility functions.

## Prerequisities
The code requires Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:
- simpy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- scipy
- statsmodels
- joypy
- shelve
